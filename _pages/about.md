I am an Associate Professor in Machine Learning at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) and Acting Director of the [UCL AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/). My research focuses on the foundational aspects of machine learning within the framework of statistical learning theory, with particular emphasis on structured prediction and exploiting problem structure to improve learning efficiency.

## Research

My work centers on leveraging various forms of structure—whether through exploiting domain knowledge, data organization, or experience from related tasks—to reduce sample complexity of learning algorithms and achieve better generalization performance in complex or low-volume regime scenarios. My research spans statistical learning theory, structured prediction, meta-learning, kernel methods, and reinforcement learning.

I maintain collaborations with several researchers including [Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi](https://cesa-bianchi.di.unimi.it/), [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/), [Lorenzo Rosasco](http://web.mit.edu/lrosasco/www/), [Massimiliano Pontil](https://www.iit.it/people-details/-/people/massimiliano-pontil), and [Alessandro Rudi](https://www.di.ens.fr/~arudi/). I currently supervise two ELLIS PhD students and am part of the [UCL ELLIS Unit](https://ellis.eu/units/ucl).

## Recognition

My research has been recognized with the [Amazon Research Award](https://www.amazon.science/research-awards) for work on structured prediction and optimal transport, and the "Top Italian Scientist in the UK" Award. I serve as Area Chair for [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) and [ICML](https://icml.cc/), and co-organize local NeurIPS and ICML mirror-workshops.

## Impact

My work has real-world applications through collaboration with [Century Tech](https://www.century.tech/), an AI-powered education platform personalizing learning for over one million students globally. I also serve on the board of directors of [Neomatrix Biotech](https://neomatrixbiotech.com/), developing personalized neoantigen cancer vaccines using synthetic DNA technology.

## Background

I obtained my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mathematics from [Università Roma Tre](https://www.uniroma3.it/) (2006, 2008), graduating with highest honors, and completed my PhD in Machine Learning and Robotics at [Università di Genova](https://unige.it/) and [Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia](https://www.iit.it/) (2012). My career includes postdoctoral positions at IIT (2012-2013), [MIT's Poggio Lab](https://poggio-lab.mit.edu/) (2013-2015), and UCL (2017-2018), followed by a position as Assistant Professor at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) (2018-2021) before joining UCL as Associate Professor.
