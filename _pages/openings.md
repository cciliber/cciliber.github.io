## Current PhD Fellowships (Starting 2026)

### ðŸ”” PhD Fellowship: Trustworthy and Reliable Agentic AI through Formal Verification

**Location:** [AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), University College London (UCL)
**Start Date:** September 2026

We are seeking an exceptional PhD candidate to join the [UCL AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) and pioneer research into the [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) of agentic AI systems. [Agentic AI](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), which combines [large language models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) with planning and tool use, holds immense promise. However, its complexity makes it difficult to trust, limiting its usefulness in both high-stakes and everyday applications.

This PhD project will focus on grounding common-sense planning and reasoning within rigorous, verifiable models. The goal is to develop novel formal methods to provide provable guarantees about agentic AI behaviour, moving beyond empirical testing towards a future of "correct-by-construction" AI systems. You will explore how to create formal specifications for complex tasks and develop techniques to ensure an agent's actions are logically sound and aligned with its goals.

**Candidate Profile:**
The ideal candidate will have a strong background in Mathematics, Computer Science or related discipline, with a deep intellectual curiosity for foundational research.

*Essential:* A first-class degree (or equivalent), a strong grasp of theoretical computer science and advanced mathematics, and excellent programming skills. A demonstrated, deep interest in learning and applying formal verification methods (e.g., [model checking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_checking), [theorem proving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving), [type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory)).

*Desirable:* Prior experience with formal methods (e.g., [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/), [Lean](https://lean-lang.org/)), statistical learning theory, or AI safety research.

### ðŸ”” PhD Fellowship: Theoretical Foundations of World Models for Reinforcement Learning

**Location:** [AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/), University College London (UCL)
**Start Date:** September 2026

We are seeking a theoretically-minded PhD candidate for foundational research in model-based [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) (RL) at the [UCL AI Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/). Current RL approaches face a critical challenge with data efficiency, often requiring complete retraining when environmental conditions or rewards change even slightly.

This project is built on the insight that [world models](https://worldmodels.github.io/) provide a principled representation for enabling robust knowledge transfer and adaptive behaviour. By possessing a coherent, abstract model of its environment, an agent can generalize and adapt far more efficiently than one learning a purely reactive policy.

The core research will rigorously explore the mathematical foundations and [operator-theoretic structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19861v2) that govern how agents construct, reason with, and update internal world models. While motivated by practical challenges, the primary focus is on establishing a robust theoretical framework that transcends ad-hoc algorithms to foster a principled, model-based theory of agency. The successful candidate will validate their theoretical insights by implementing and testing these new constructs in single and multi-agent environments.

**Candidate Profile:**
We are looking for a candidate with a strong aptitude for abstract reasoning and a desire to tackle the fundamental questions of AI.

*Essential:* A first-class degree (or equivalent) in Mathematics, Theoretical Computer Science, or a related field. A proven, strong background in advanced mathematics (e.g., abstract algebra, operator theory, probability). Excellent programming skills, with the ability to translate complex theoretical ideas into working code.

*Desirable:* Prior experience or coursework in reinforcement learning and game theory. Familiarity with modern deep learning frameworks.
